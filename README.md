A project made for an imaginary online academy called Command Break.

Backstory:

I was in desperate need for a portfolio website, where I can show off my work, and past history and experience, as I was starting my career in the world of freelancing. 
Therefore, my goal was to create a second to none portfolio website, containing all important sections that can introduce me in the best way possible,
such as about me, services, and past projects sections.

Design:

So now, after deciding the main idea of the website, we need to figure out what the design will actually be like. 
Since it was a website related to my career (Front-end web development), it needed to have main colours of coding languages' logos (HTML, CSS, JS), as well as a modern interface in general.
And after quick research, the main colour pallette which I was going to stick to was the following:

#E34C26, #264DE4, #F0DB4F

Results:

After being satisfied with the colour pallette, structure, and main design of the website, the construction of the website was not a big issue. And I was able to complete
the website for the public to see. I also had a resume designed, which can be downloaded through the website. For more information on the project, you may go ahead and check
out the YouTube video uploaded on my YouTube channel, showing off the website in a simple and clear matter.
